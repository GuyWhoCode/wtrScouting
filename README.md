# What is a Scouting App?
Essentially, a Scouting App functions much like a Google Form. It takes in user input using a series of checkboxes and Yes/No Questions. Once inputted, the Teams are ranked based on the inputted data. This information is vital in Robotics competitions as the Quarterfinals require teams to draft teams of 3 to compete. In the Qualification matches, these teams of 3 are randomly generated. By gathering information on other teams' performance, it ensures that the best teams are drafted to maximize the chances to win.
